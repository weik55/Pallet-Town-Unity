This is sample code to understand how developing a top down 2D game like Pokemon would work in Unity. This is code that simulates "Pallet Town" from the original Pokemon games. 

The code included here is not comprehensive. It is only a sample to show some of the work I have done. The IP to Pokemon belongs to Gamefreak, the Pokemon Company, and Nintendo.

Thanks.
